    <p>Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot 
        (but may be cool or cold), that is made by combining ingredients of 
        meat or vegetables with stock, milk, or water. Hot soups are additionally 
        characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors 
        are extracted, forming a broth. Soups are similar to stews, and in some cases 
        there may not be a clear distinction between the two; however, soups generally 
        have more liquid (broth) than stews.</p>

        <p>In traditional French cuisine, soups are classified into two main groups: clear 
        soups and thick soups. The established French classifications of clear soups are 
        bouillon and consommé. Thick soups are classified depending upon the type of 
        thickening agent used: purées are vegetable soups thickened with starch; bisques 
        are made from puréed shellfish or vegetables thickened with cream; cream soups 
        may be thickened with béchamel sauce; and veloutés are thickened with eggs, 
        butter, and cream. Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and broths 
        include rice, lentils, flour, and grains; many popular soups also include pumpkin, 
        carrots, potatoes, pig's trotters and bird's nests.</p>
        
        <p>Other types of soup include fruit soups, dessert soups, pulse soups like split 
        pea, cold soups and other styles.</p>

    <h2>id="History">History</h2>
    <img  src="/../img/soup.jpeg" width="300" height="150" alt="soup">
                <p>The earliest evidence for soup in human culinary practice dates to the 
                Upper Palaeolithic period when thermally altered rocks became commonplace 
                in the archaeological record.[3][4] Small boiling pits are present on the 
                Gravettian site Pavlov VI.[5] Cobbles were heated on the hearth and then 
                placed into the water to bring it to boil. However, the antiquity of soup 
                is highly contested. Based on ethnographic evidence, some archaeologists 
                conjecture that early humans employed hides and watertight baskets to boil 
                water.</p>

                <p>The word soup comes from French soupe ("soup", "broth"), which comes through 
                Vulgar Latin suppa ("bread soaked in broth") from a Germanic source, from 
                which also comes the word "sop", a piece of bread used to soak up soup or a 
                thick stew.</p>
                
                <p>The word restaurant (meaning "[something] restoring") was first used in 
                France in the 16th century, to refer to a highly concentrated, inexpensive soup, 
                sold by street vendors, that was advertised as an antidote to physical exhaustion.[
                citation needed] In 1765, a Parisian entrepreneur opened a shop specializing in such soups. 
                This prompted the use of the modern word restaurant to refer to eating establishments.</p>
                
                <p>In the US, the first colonial cookbook was published by William Parks in Williamsburg, 
                Virginia, in 1742, based on Eliza Smith's The Compleat Housewife; or Accomplished Gentlewoman's 
                Companion, and it included several recipes for soups and bisques. A 1772 cookbook, The Frugal 
                Housewife, contained an entire chapter on the topic. English cooking dominated early colonial 
                cooking; but as new immigrants arrived from other countries, other national soups gained popularity. 
                In particular, German immigrants living in Pennsylvania were famous for their potato soups. In 1794, 
                Jean Baptiste Gilbert Payplat dis Julien, a refugee from the French Revolution, opened an eating 
                establishment in Boston called "The Restorator", and became known as the "Prince of Soups". The 
                first American cooking pamphlet dedicated to soup recipes was written in 1882 by Emma Ewing: 
                Soups and Soup Making.</p>
                
                <p>Portable soup was devised in the 18th century by boiling seasoned meat until a 
                thick, resinous syrup was left that could be dried and stored for months at a time.</p>

            <p>Commercial soup became popular with the invention of canning in the 19th century, and 
                today a great variety of canned and dried soups are on the market.</p>
    <h3>id="Canned">Canned</h3>
            <p>Canned soup can be condensed, in which case it is prepared by adding water 
                (or sometimes milk) or it can be "ready-to-eat", meaning that no additional 
                liquid is needed before eating. Condensed soup (invented in 1897 by John T. Dorrance, 
                a chemist with the Campbell Soup Company[7][8]) allows soup to be packaged into a 
                smaller can and sold at a lower price than other canned soups. The soup is usually 
                doubled in volume by adding a "can full" of water or milk, about 10 US fluid ounces 
                (300 ml). The "ready-to-eat" variant can be prepared by simply heating the contents 
                of the can on a kitchen stove or in a microwave oven, rather than actually cooking 
                anything. Such soups can be used as a base for homemade soups, with the consumer 
                adding anything from a few vegetables to eggs, meat, cream or pasta.</p>
    <h3>id="Dried">Dried</h3>
            <p>Dry soup mixes are sold by many manufacturers, and are reconstituted with hot water; 
                other fresh ingredients may then be added.</p>

    <h2>id="Types">Types</h2>
    <h3>id="Dessert">Dessert</h3>
                <p>Many cultures partake in cold dessert soup.</p>
    <h3>id="Fruit">Fruit</h3>
                <p>Fruit soups are prepared using fruit as a primary ingredient, and may be 
                    served warm or cold depending on the recipe. Many varieties of fruit soups 
                    exist, and they may be prepared based upon the availability of seasonal fruit.</p>
    <h3>id="Cold">Cold</h3>
                <p>Cold soups are a particular variation on the traditional soup, wherein the 
                    temperature when served is kept at or below room temperature. They may 
                    be sweet or savory.</p>
    <h3>id="Asian">Asian</h3>
                <p>A feature of East Asian soups not normally found in Western cuisine is the use 
                    of tofu in soups. Many traditional East Asian soups are typically broths, 
                    "clear soups", or starch thickened soups.</p>
